<h1>KnockKnock</h1>
KnockKnock is an iOS app, made on Swift 3. We could use it as our assistance and get required reults. Here, we use jSON form to get the object values and use the app.
 It utilises the new Speech framework in iOS 10. 
Be sure to drag in "test.m4a" from the project folder and into Xcode so that the app can successfully find and use it.
